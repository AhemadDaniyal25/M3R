# M3R-Multimodal-3D-Reconstruction-Rendering-System
a Dockerized 3D reconstruction system that reconstructs dense volumes from sparse/noisy 2D inputs using a hybrid 3D-UNet + NeRF-lite implicit head, includes a differentiable renderer, REST API demo, and evaluation on fastMRI + BraTS showing X% SSIM gain and Y% preservation of tumor Dice.
